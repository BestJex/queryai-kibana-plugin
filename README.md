- Assistance
  - Contact help@query.ai for any assistance with below installation steps.
- Prerequisites
  - Download and install Elasticsearch and Kibana
  - AI-Analyst is supported and tested with Kibana 7.x and 6.x
- Install AI-Analyst plugin
  - cd to your kibana root folder, then run the following line.
  - Install from URL: Example Kibana 7.3.0 : 
  ```
  ./bin/kibana-plugin install https://github.com/query-ai/queryai-kibana-plugin/releases/download/7.3/ai_analyst-7.3.0.zip
  ```
  - Alternately, download the plugin zip and install : Example Kibana 6.7.2 : 
  ```
  ./bin/kibana-plugin install file:///my-local-file-path/ai_analyst-6.7.2.zip
  ```
  - Other versions : [https://github.com/query-ai/queryai-kibana-plugin/releases](https://github.com/query-ai/queryai-kibana-plugin/releases) Can't find your version? Kibana requires exact match of plugin version to the Kibana version. If you can't find AI-Analyst plugin zip for a Kibana release, download the closest versioned plugin zip file, unzip the file, change the version number in package.json, rezip the file, and then install using the file url example above. 
  - Restart Kibana after plugin install.
  - NOTE: You do not need to install any other component beyond this plugin.

### Configuration
Add these lines in kibana.yml. Generally, the kibana.yml can be found at 	
`/etc/kibana`.
```
csp.rules:
  # current defaults
  - "script-src 'unsafe-eval' 'nonce-{nonce}'"
  - "worker-src blob'"

**Note:** The lines above are telling the Kibana's content security policy that [https://ai.query.ai/](https://ai.query.ai/) is a safe website to load javascript from. Without adding the above lines, the Kibana plugin wonâ€™t work. Your data stays between your browser and your Elastic stack. NLP translation of your questions to search syntax happens via our cloud APIs. Please contact help@query.ai for any assistance or further information.
